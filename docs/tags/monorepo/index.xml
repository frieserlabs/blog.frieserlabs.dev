      <description>Recently, we have adopted the monorepo philosophy for our projects at my work team. We started to use it in a project that has multiple services.
The first concern that came to our mind, is that a single change in one of our services or common libraries, could break other services. When someone makes a change to any library to correct a bug or introduce a new feature for a particular service, it could break compatibility with other services or affect the behavior of another service without anyone noticing.</description>

      <description>Gazelle is a Bazel build file generator for Bazel projects. Sometimes, we need to ignore some folder where Gazelle look into to generate build files.
Add this to your root BUILD.bazel file:
# BUILD.bazel # gazelle:exclude folder_path </description>
